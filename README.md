Just trying to create a digital, responsive, version of the book The Warlock of Firetop Mountain by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone.

At least one game already exists, but it is too different from the core adventure gamebook experience. With this project I want to keep it as faithful as possible to the gaming experience I used to have with my brother as a kid.

Consider buying the original book if you like this!
