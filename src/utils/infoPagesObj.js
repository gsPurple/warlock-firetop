        pageContent: "There is one true way through the Warlock's dungeon and it will take you several attempts to find it. Make notes and draw a map as you explore - this map will be invaluable in future adventures and enable you to progress rapidly through to unexplored sections.\n\nNot all rooms contain treasure; many merely contain traps and creatures which you will no doubt fall foul of. There are many 'wild goose chase' passages and whilst you may indeed progress through the dungeon, you will not take the Warlock's treasure unless you have picked up certain specific items on the way.\n\nSeveral keys will be found in dungeon rooms. Only by arriving at the Warlock's treasure with the correct keys to open his chest will you get to his treasure. You can expect many frustrations in Firetop Mountain.\nThe one true way involves a minimum of risk and any player, no matter how weak on initial rolls, should be able to get through very easily.\n\nMay the luck of the gods go with you on the adventure ahead!",

        pageContent: "The Warlock of the Firetop Mountain is a different kind of book. You will embark on a perilous quest to find the Warlock's hidden treasure. The treasure is hidden deep within a dungeon which you must explore, populated with a multitude of underworld monsters which you must fight and kill - or be killed in the attempt.\n\nPart novel, with its exciting story, and part game, with its elaborate combat system, this book holds many adventures in store for you. Each page presents different challenges, and the choices you make will send you on different paths and into different battles. You may get lost in the maze, have your strength sapped by a hideous Wight, die in a battle with Orcs, or fall to any one of the dozens of creatures guarding the Warlock's treasure-vaults. Or, with courage, determination and a fair amount of luck, you may survive through all traps and battles to the innermost chambers of the Warlock's domain where the treasure is hidden.\n\nMagic and monsters are as real as life in this sword and sorcery treasure hunt which will keep you spellbound for hours on end!",

Your LUCK score indicates how naturally lucky you are. Luck - and magic - are facts of life in the fantasy kingdom you are about to explore.\n\nBATTLES:\nYou will often come across battles against a creature of some sort. An option to flee may be given, but if not - or if you choose to attack the creature anyway - you must resolve the battle until you or the creature die (STAMINA reaches 0).\n\nESCAPING:\nWhen you run away from a battle the creature automatically gets in one wound on you (you lose 2 STAMINA) as you flee. Such is the price of cowardice. Note that the option to escape isn't always given to you.",

But beware! Using luck is a risky business and if you are unlucky, the results could be disastrous.\n\nTo use luck we will roll two dice. If the number rolled is equal to or less than your current LUCK score, you have been lucky and the result will go in your favour. If not, you have been unlucky and you will be penalized.\nThis procedure is known as Testing your Luck. Each time you do it, one point will be subtracted from your current LUCK score. Thus you will soon realize that the more you rely on your luck, the more risky this will become.\n\nWhen in battle, if you have just wounded the creature, you may test your Luck and, if you are lucky, you will do an extra 2 points of damage. However, if you are unlucky, you will only take 1 point from the creature's STAMINA.\nYou can also use luck to minimize the damage a creature does to you when you get wounded, but if you're unlucky you will suffer 3 points of damage, instead of the normal 2.",

Before your arrival at the foot of Firetop Mountain, you spent several days with the townsfolk of a local village some two days' journey from the base. Being a likeable sort of person, you found it easy to get on with the local peasants. Although they told many stories about the mysterious Warlock's sanctuary, you could not feel sure that all - or indeed any - of these were based on fact. The villagers had seen many adventurers pass through on their way to the mountain, but very few ever returned. The journey ahead was extremely dangerous, that you knew for certain. Of those who returned to the village, none contemplated going back to Firetop Mountain.\n\nThere seemed to be some truth in the rumour that the Warlock's treasure was stored in a magnificent chest with two locks, and the keys to these locks were guarded by various creatures within the dungeons. The Warlock himself was a sorcerer of great power. Some described him as old, others as young. Some said his power came from an enchanted deck of cards, others from the silky black gloves that he wore.",

The locals also encouraged you to keep a good map of your wanderings, for without a map you would end up hopelessly lost within the mountain.\n\nWhen it finally came to your day of leaving, the whole village turned out to wish you a safe journey. Tears came to the eyes of many of the women, young and old alike. You couldn't help wondering whether they were tears of sorrow shed by eyes which would never see you alive again . . .",
